I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of International Relations at the [Universidad Alfonso X](https://www.uax.com/) in Madrid and a Research Associate at the [Instituto de Iberoamérica](https://iberoame.usal.es/). I received my PhD in Political Science at the [Universidad de Salamanca](https://www.usal.es/) in 2025, following an MA in Latin American Studies from the same institution and a BA in International Relations from [Universidad Pontificia Comillas](https://www.comillas.edu/) in Madrid. 

**I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market**

My research focuses on political attitudes and preferences, specifically the causes and consequences of political trust in contexts of inequality, with a regional specialization in Latin America. I use a mixed-method approach that combines multilevel analyses of both experimental and observational data with in-depth interviews and extensive fieldwork. My research has been published in *[Latin American Politics and Society](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-politics-and-society/article/race-inequality-and-political-trust-in-latin-america/DF147D983D674CE25D1E5BE34EAF1221)*, *[Journal of Politics in Latin America](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1866802X251384315)*, *[Social Justice Research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-025-00452-6)*, *[Bulletin of Latin American Research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/blar.13591)*, and *[Revista de Ciencia Política](https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-090X2023005000109&script=sci_abstract)*, among others.
